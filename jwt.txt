There are a few things you can do to get more secure with JWT:

Use a strong signing algorithm. JWT tokens are typically signed using a secret key. The stronger the signing algorithm, the more secure the token will be. You should use a signing algorithm like RS256 or ES256.

Use a long expiration time. JWT tokens should have an expiration time. This will help to prevent tokens from being used after they have been compromised. You should set the expiration time to a reasonable amount of time, such as 1 hour or 24 hours.

Use a long expiration time. JWT tokens should have an expiration time. This will help to prevent tokens from being used after they have been compromised. You should set the expiration time to a reasonable amount of time, such as 1 hour or 24 hours.

Require re-authentication periodically. You should require users to re-authenticate periodically. This will help to ensure that their tokens are not compromised. You can require users to re-authenticate every 30 minutes, 1 hour, or 24 hours.

Use a third-party token management service. There are a number of third-party token management services that can help you to secure your JWT tokens. These services typically offer features such as encryption, expiration times, and re-authentication.

By following these best practices, you can help to protect your JWT tokens from being compromised
Here are some additional tips for securing JWT:
Use a secure secret key. The secret key that you use to sign JWT tokens should be kept secret. You should not store the secret key in your code or in a configuration file. Instead, you should store the secret key in a secure location, such as a hardware security token.
Use a different secret key for each environment. You should use a different secret key for each environment, such as development, staging, and production. This will help to prevent attackers from compromising your tokens if they are able to access one environment.
Rotate your secret keys regularly. You should rotate your secret keys regularly. This will help to protect your tokens if they are ever compromised. You should rotate your secret keys every 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year.
Be aware of the risks. No security measure is perfect. There is always some risk involved in using JWT tokens. You should be aware of the risks and take steps to mitigate them.
