Sure. Here are some benefits of hiding the implementation of a service in a controller by using an interface:

1. It makes the controller more readable and easier to understand. 
    The controller only needs to know about the methods that are defined in the interface, not the implementation details of the service. 
    This makes the controller code more readable and easier to understand.
2. It makes the controller more testable. The controller can be tested without having to know about the implementation details of the service. 
    This makes the controller code more testable and easier to maintain.
3. It makes the controller more flexible. The controller can be used with different implementations of the service.
    This makes the controller more flexible and easier to adapt to changes in the service.
